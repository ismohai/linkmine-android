Then in the one where the Great Sage returned, which is in that book, you create it randomly, but you don't create it randomly, that is, you have several built-in settings, as well as foreshadowing, locations, and other things. Locations are not needed, that is, there are several built-in settings, and then the character settings are fine, because if you demonstrate it in the tutorial, you won't switch to other settings, so you only need the character settings. Then for the foreshadowing piece, make a few, and that's it.
