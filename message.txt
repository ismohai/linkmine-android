Cancel the tutorial of the bottom function, that is, the four small icon buttons, and cancel that part of the tutorial at the bottom. Then, it is the one of the Return of the Great Sage, won't a book called the Return of the Great Sage be created in the content management place? Then it will only delete the book of the Return of the Great Sage when it clicks Finish or the user manually closes the tutorial window.Then, there is another point, that is, when I enter the tutorial and enter the editing area, the first chapter will be automatically opened.
