Or the tutorial. When switching from step 8 to step 9, or from step 9 to step 8, there will be a problem, that is, it completes the window first, that is, after the content in the window changes, before moving the position of the window. And what I want is that it changes and moves synchronously. And the spotlight is also in this window, which prompts the window of the window. After the content changes, the spotlight slowly disappears and then shows up in another place. Please fix this problem, okay?It's the same problem with steps nine through 10, and steps 10 through 9.Also, in steps 10 and 11, when introducing synchronization and Recycle Bin, the spotlight on the left sidebar only focuses on the synchronization icon button or the Recycle Bin icon button, do not focus, do not focus on the entire sidebarAnother one is the sidebar navigation. The spotlight is too big and too high. It only needs to focus all the subjective buttons. But if it is actually focused now, it will also focus some blank areas. Please fix this problem.
